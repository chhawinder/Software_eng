phases:
Requirements analysis and specification phase:
Design Phase:
Implementation and unit testing
Integration and System Testing
Operation and maintenance phase

waterfall model is suited where:
->small project
->requiment are nor changed regularly
->resources are well available and prepared

advantage:
->simple to impliment
->start and end point are fixed and probably same everytime 
->cost and complete date of the project can be defined before hand
disadvantage
->risk factor is very high so suitable for big projects
->changes can't be accepted while deveopment phase
->testing is done at last so risk of project failure increases
->model is very rigid in nature
