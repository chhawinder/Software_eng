->it is an iterative approach for software development
->each iteration is for 1-4weeks

2 roles in agile :

scrum master:
->team lead that helps team members to follow agile practices
product owners:
->is one who runs the product from a business perspective

agile sdlc:
ut combines both iterative and icremental process models 
it breaks the product into small incremental builds and they are called chunks
in this customer is able to see the result and understand weather they are stisfied by the product or not
it is difficult to estimate the resources and developement cost.

Advantages of Agile SDLC
Project is divided into short and transparent iterations.
It has a flexible change process.
It minimizes the risk of software development.
Quick release of the first product version.
The correctness of functional requirement is implemented into the development process.
Customer can see the result and understand whether he/she is satisfied with it or not.

Disadvantages of Agile SDLC
The development team should be highly professional and client-oriented.
New requirement may be a conflict with the existing architecture.
With further correction and change, there may be chances that the project will cross the expected time.
There may be difficult to estimate the final coast of the project due to constant iteration.
A defined requirement is absent.

What is the product backlog?
A product backlog is a registered list of work for the development team. It is driven from the roadmap and its requirement



what is Scrum?
Scrum is a framework that helps agile teams to work together. Using it, the team members can deliver and sustain the complex product.

What are sprints?
With scrum, a product is built in a series of repetition called sprints. It breaks down big complex projects into bite-size pieces. It makes projects more manageable
