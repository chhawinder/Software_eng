What is SE?
it is a systematic disciplined costefficient technique to develop a software model
SE was important because:
->to manage large softwares
->cost management
->quality management(better queality of the product delivered)
->software is dynamic in nature and could adjust in changing world

Importance of software e?
reduces complexity :to handle big projects se could be used to handle the complications
minimize cost: by anaylising we are able to decide what are the crucial things on which we need to spend our money
decrese time : se could help to devide the work properly and lay down a work flow for the project and this could help in time management and will avoid the time waste
reliable software: by se we have already measured all the risks and that make our software more reliable and robust

Software Crisis 
->is a term used in computer science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time.
-> The software crisis was due to using the same workforce, same methods, and same tools even though rapidly increasing software demand, 
->the complexity of software, and software challenges. 
With the increase in software complexity, many software problems arise because existing methods were insufficient.

->If we will use the same workforce, same methods, and same tools after the fast increase in software demand, 
software complexity, and software challenges, then there arise some problems like software budget problems, 
software efficiency problems, software quality problems, software management, and delivery problem, etc. 
This condition is called a Software Crisis.

Q.2: Give one of the real examples of a Software Crisis?
Answer:

One of the famous software failures in computer science is Therac-25. It is a machine that is used to deliver radiation therapy to Cancer Patients.
