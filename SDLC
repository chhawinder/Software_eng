SDLC:
software development life cycle:it is pictorial and daigrammantic representation of the software life cycle .
a life cycle model represents how all methods required to make a software sucessful are organised.

need of sdlc:
->the process becomes more systematic and disciplined using sdlc
->team gets a clear idea of what should be done in the existing time span
->avoid the chous and failure of the project
->monitering the progress becomes an easy task 

stages of sdlc cycle:
->planning :requirement analysis is the most imporant and neccasary stage,planning for the quality , identifing the project risk is involved in this step
->defining requirements : we define all the possible documents ,enginers and all other resources that we need are planned . this step accomplishes the srs model that is software requirement specificatuons
->design 
->develop
->testing
->deploy
->maintain

SDLC Models:
software develpoment process models.
important phases of sdlc lifecycle:
->waterfall model
->rad model
->spiral model
->v-model
->incremental miodel
->agile model
->iterative model
->bigbang model
